# nvim.config
Simple, effective nvim config, with Mason.nvim, DAP, LSP, and CMP support. Minimal base16 colors for scheme, and todo comments for better commenting.
Foundation for solid IDE, need to look into more Java support, other than that supports: Python, TS/JS, Rust, HTML/CSS, and Lua. Happy Hacking.
